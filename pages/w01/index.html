            I could review how to create a repository and even publish it to
            GitHub pages. I could also practice loading a
            <strong>ul</strong> list with data from an array. With this
            portfolio, I will be able to submit my work more cleanly.

          <h3 class="topic-title">Mobile UX Design</h3>
          <p class="topic-body">
            Through mobile-first design, we can focus on the most relevant
            features of our apps and create more beautiful and clean apps.
            There's a lot more online traffic than before mobile devices.
            <strong>Responsive is not the same as mobile first!</strong> Besides
            the size of elements, we also design a more mobile-compatible
            bandwidth. This paradigm is here to stay! People will use mobile
            devices forever. We can design a better UX experience when we come
            to understand the users. UX has a lot to do with psychology. Knowing
            the way people think will let us design more intuitive experiences.

          <h3 class="topic-title">Javascript Lesson</h3>
          <p class="topic-body">
            Object-oriented programming is a way to create different objects
            from one model object. The objects created using this model, are
            called instances of the object. This model object is like a
            blueprint. Constructor functions are a way to define this blueprint.
            Using classes is a way to create constructor functions?? What is the
            advantage of using classes instead of just constructor functions?
            "This" is a JavaScript keyword that allows me to access the object,
            class, or constructor from a method of the object. Modularizing
            JavaScripts apps is a great way to organize better the code. This
            way, I can make each module have a specific responsibility and also
            provides mantainability to the app in the future.
