              Functions are a super important part of JavaScript. There are
              several ways to declare functions and several ways to call them.
              Functions can be declared using
              <strong>function declaration</strong> method as a
              <strong>named function:</strong>
            </p>
            <pre>function sum(num1, num2){}</pre>
            <strong>Anonymous function</strong> (assigned to a variable):
            <pre>const sum = function(num1, num2){}</pre>
            Also as an <strong>arrow function:</strong>
            <pre>const sum = (num1, num2) => {}</pre>
          </div>
          <h3 class="topic-title">Hoisting</h3>
          <div class="topic-body">
            <p>
              Hoisting is a little tricky concept but as I understand Hoisting
              is the fact that JavaScript moves all variables and function
              declarations to the top of the current scope. The function can be
              called before its declaration, if declared as a function
              declaration. The <strong>declaration</strong> of variables
              declared with "var" keyword is moved to the top as well but it is
              not hoisted its value assignment, so it can be only used after it
              was assigned a value.
            </p>

          <h3 class="topic-title">Utilities</h3>
          <div class="topic-body">
            <p>
              Window: Window object has some useful methods like
              <code>prompt()</code>, <code>alert()</code>,
              <code>confirm()</code>. The <code>window.location</code> property
              will allow me to redirect the user to a new location. I did not
              know the <code>window.history</code> property with its method
              "go". It is very useful when locating the user. By using
              <code>window.resizeTo(width, height)</code>, I can resize the
              window!
            </p>

              "Cookies can be used to store small pieces of information between
              requests using the document.cookie property" I can set cookies
              with js.
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> element can use in js as a way to
              specify an HTML template that will not be rendered when
              DOMContentLoaded is triggered but is to be run during runtime.
