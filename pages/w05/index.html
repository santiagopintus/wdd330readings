            <h4>There are mainly 3 types of errors:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                System errors: when there's an issue related to devices or
                external programs the actual program is interacting with.
              </li>
              <li>
                Programmer errors: Errors performed by the author of the code,
                faulty logic, or even a typo.
              </li>
              <li>
                User error: When the user enters data incorrectly or when the
                user performs an action that the program is not ready to handle.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Why is it important to test and Debug?</h4>
            <p>
              JavaScript is very flexible when it comes to errors. Because of
              this, occasionally, errors are difficult to spot. This can cause
              errors to accumulate in our programs without even noticing them
              generating a huge error at the end.
            </p>
            <p>
              To handle this, programmers should look for errors all the time,
              causing the program to show the errors in a noticeable way. One
              way to achieve this is using the "strict mode" that causes some
              bad practices or deprecated features as errors. To use "strict
              mode" just include the 'use strict'; line at the beginning of the
              js file or function.
            </p>
            <h4>Linting Tools</h4>
            <p>
              Linting tools are used to help write quality code following good
              practices of ES6. They can help programmers follow a specific
              style guide for the code such as using simple or double quotation
              marks all over the code, following the same indentation always,
              etc.
            </p>
            <h4>Feature Detection</h4>
            <p>
              Our programs can be run on different devices or browsers that
              support different features. It is prudent to catch any feature
              that is not supported in that specific device or browser and
              handle it properly. For instance, wrap the code in a conditional
              sentence:
            </p>
            <pre>
if(module) {
  module.method()
}
            </pre>
          </div>
        </article>
      </section>
    </main>
